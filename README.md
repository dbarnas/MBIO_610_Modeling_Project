# MBIO610 Mathematical Ecology Final Project
### Danielle Barnas, Yr 1 PhD student

Data used for this project are adapted from data I collected during my Master's thesis project in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Data include benthic percent cover of coral and macroalgae+turf along a submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) gradient.

Data are processed in R, and the model is produced in python.
